# CheckersAI
AI to play checkers

After running "make"
-run ./BoardImg to play against an AI
-run ./AIFight to watch two AI fight it out

To play:
bottom left corner is: 0 0, the top left is: 0 7, top right is: 7 7, bottom right is: 7 0.
You can change recursive depth of search to change difficulty by changing the depth variable in BoardImg.cpp, but above 6-7 it will be to slow to play against.
